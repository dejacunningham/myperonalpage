	      Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener
		  <br></br>
		  Summary of each chapter
		 <br></br></i></font>
		 
		<u>Chapter 4- The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.</u><br></br>
		 Charlie urges Michael to put down his goals in Chapter 4,because Michael was dissatisfied with his current position in his profession. Charlie then explained to him that setting goals that challenge you and force you to do things differently will take him to the future he desires. He divides it into smaller chunks so Michael understands the distinction between long-rage and short-rage goals.
		</u><br></br>
		 <u>Chapter 5- Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.</u><br></br>
	     He discusses time management and how to use your time wisely every day in this chapter. Spend time on activities that will propel you ahead and fill your cup. It is critical to manage your time effectively since you will never get it back.
		</u><br></br>
		<u>Chapter 6- Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</u><br></br>
		Charlie taught Michael in Chapter 6 the significance of surrounding yourself with people who inspire you to achieve better rather than individuals who are always whining about their life and doing nothing to improve them. If you want to be successful, surround yourself with successful people. When you're around your friends, family, coworkers, and so on, you should feel empowered to better your life in whatever manner you can.
		 </u><br></br>
		<u>Chapter 7- Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune</u><br></br>
		What you teach yourself is referred to as self-education.Charlie taught Michael in Chapter 6 the significance of continuing to study throughout life in order to develop and progress. Formal education alone will not ensure your success in life. Three strategies to maintain learning are to read books so that you may be exposed to new worlds, thinking, and culture, to observe successful people, and to reflect on and learn from your own experiences.

		 <u>Reflection</u><br></br>
		I would absolutely utilize what I learned from this book in my life from now on since I would love to be successful but not spend my entire life doing it. I'm not one to write down my objectives, but after reading this book, I may rethink. I'm similar to Michael in that we're holding on to connections that we know aren't necessarily driving us because we're frightened to meet new people. But I must remember that successful individuals want interactions
		with other successful people who will push, challenge, and inspire them to grow.
